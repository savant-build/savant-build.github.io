    <h2>What is Savant?</h2>
    <p>
      Savant is a modern build tool that uses a Groovy DSL for the build files. Savant is fully SemVer compliant and
      handles the most complex dependency graphs easily. Savant uses a plugin approach to quickly adding complex build
      logic to projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main difference between Savant and other build systems is that Savant does not allow plugins to add targets
      to the build. This decision makes Savant declarative and simplifies the entire system by removing the need to
      manage inter-plugin dependencies (i.e. the JUnit plugin depends on the Java plugin).
