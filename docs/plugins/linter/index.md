The Linter plugin runs static analysis tools on your project's source code. Currently, it supports PMD for Java projects. The features of the plugin are also the public methods of the plugin class, so you can refer to the [Groovy Doc](docs/) for more information.

**LATEST VERSION: 2.0.3**

## Loading the plugin

Here is how you load this plugin:

~~~~ groovy
linter = loadPlugin(id: "org.savantbuild.plugin:linter:2.0.3")
~~~~

## Settings

The Linter plugin has one setting for the report output directory:

### Report directory

The directory where analysis reports are written. This defaults to `build/linter-reports`:

~~~~ groovy
linter.settings.reportDirectory = Paths.get("build/linter-reports")
~~~~

## Running PMD

The `pmd` method executes PMD analysis on your source code. At minimum, you must specify the rule sets to use:

~~~~ groovy
linter.pmd(ruleSets: ["config/pmd-rules.xml"])
~~~~

You can configure the analysis with additional attributes:

~~~~ groovy
linter.pmd(
  ruleSets: ["config/pmd-rules.xml"],
  reportFormat: "html",
  reportFileName: "pmd-report",
  languageVersion: "17",
  inputPath: "src/main/java",
  minimumPriority: "MEDIUM",
  failOnViolations: true
)
~~~~
